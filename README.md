About this section
==================

Those code allows us to use a projector in order to grow algae and to see the growth difference in function of the frequency and a camera in order to take out the data. We project an image of colored circles at the surface of a sample of algae in order to analyze cell density by visualizing them into each circle. With different wavelength of light on each circle ( with black one as a control ), we can know whether using them will modify the distribution of the cells in the circles.
